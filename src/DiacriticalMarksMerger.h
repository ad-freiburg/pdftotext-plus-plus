// Diacritical marks exist in two variants: a "non-combining" variant and a "combining" variant.
// For example, for the grave accent ("`"), the non-combining variant is 0x0060 ("GRAVE ACCENT"),
// and the combining variant is 0x0300 ("COMBINING GRAVE ACCENT"). In PDF, diacritic marks can
// occur in both variants. But for merging, we need the combining variant. This map maps
// non-combining diacritic marks to their combining equivalents.

   * This method merges each diacritic mark with its respective base character.
   *
   * The basic approach is as follows: The characters of each page are iterated. For each
   * character, it is checked whether or not it represents a diacritic mark. If so, the horizontal
   * overlap with the respective previous and next character is computed. The diacritic mark is
   * then merged with the character yielding the larger horizontal overlap (if this overlap exceeds
   * a certain threshold).
   *
   * Let `mark` be a diacritic mark and `base` the base character with which the diacritic mark
   * should be merged. The actual merging process is realized as follows:
   *  - `mark->isDiacriticMarkOfBaseChar` is set to `base`,
   *  - `base->isBaseCharOfDiacriticMark` is set to `mark`,
   *  - `base->textWithDiacriticMark` is set to the string containing the character with the
   *     diacritic mark represented by a single character,
   *  - `base->position` is updated to the bounding box surrounding both characters.
   *
   * NOTE: The character representing the diacritic mark is *not* removed from `page->characters`.
   * If you want to exclude the character from further processing, you need to check whether or not
   * `mark->isDiacriticMarkOfBaseChar` is set.
