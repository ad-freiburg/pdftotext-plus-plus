// Diacritic marks exist in two variants: a "non-combining" variant and a "combining" variant.
// For example, for the grave accent ("`"), the non-combining variant is 0x0060 ("GRAVE ACCENT"),
// and the combining variant is 0x0300 ("COMBINING GRAVE ACCENT"). In PDF, diacritic marks can
// occur in both variants. But for merging, we need the combining variant. This map maps
// non-combining diacritic marks to their combining equivalents.

   * This method merges each diacritic mark with its respective base glyph.
   *
   * The basic approach is as follows: The glyphs of each page are iterated. For each glyph, it is
   * checked whether or not it represents a diacritic mark. If so, the horizontal overlap with the
   * respective previous and next glyph is computed. The diacritic mark is merged with the glyph
   * yielding the larger horizontal overlap (if this overlap exceeds a certain threshold).
   *
   * Let `mark` be a diacritic mark and `base` the base glyph with which the diacritic mark
   * should be merged. The actual merging process is realized as follows:
   *  - `mark->isDiacriticMarkOfBaseGlyph` is set to `base`,
   *  - `base->isBaseGlyphOfDiacriticMark` is set to `mark`,
   *  - `base->textWithDiacriticMark` is set to the string containing the character with diacritic
   *     mark represented by a single character,
   *  - `base->position` is updated to the bounding box surrounding both glyphs.
   *
   * NOTE: The glyph representing the diacritic mark are *not* removed from the `page->glyphs`. If
   *  you want to exclude the glyph from further processing, you need to check whether or not
   *  `mark->isDiacriticMarkOfBaseGlyph` is set.
